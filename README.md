> Pi.ai conversational agent provider.

## Install

```bash
vibe plugin install @vibecontrols/vibe-plugin-ai-pi
```

Or install the npm package directly into an existing project that hosts the VibeControls agent:

```bash
bun add @vibecontrols/vibe-plugin-ai-pi
# or
npm install @vibecontrols/vibe-plugin-ai-pi
```

## How it works

AI **providers** implement the `AIProvider` contract from `@vibecontrols/vibe-plugin-ai` (meta). Once installed and registered, the agent can route prompts, hooks and MCP requests through this provider alongside any others you have configured. The meta plugin handles fan-out, provider selection and capability negotiation.

This package is a **provider** registered against the `@vibecontrols/vibe-plugin-ai` meta plugin. Install the meta plugin first; this provider plugs into it.
